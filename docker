How to Install Docker on Ubuntu Machine

First, update your existing list of packages:
•	sudo apt update
 
Next, install a few prerequisite packages which let apt use packages over HTTPS:
•	sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
 
Then add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:
•	curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
 
Add the Docker repository to APT sources:
•	sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
 
Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:
•	sudo apt update
 
Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu repo:
•	apt-cache policy docker-ce
 
You’ll see output like this, although the version number for Docker may be different:
Output of apt-cache policy docker-ce
docker-ce:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 18.03.1~ce~3-0~ubuntu
  Version table:
     18.03.1~ce~3-0~ubuntu 500
        500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic/stable amd64 Packages
 
Notice that docker-ce is not installed, but the candidate for installation is from the Docker repository for Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic).
Finally, install Docker:
•	sudo apt install docker-ce
 
Docker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot. Check that it’s running:
•	sudo systemctl status docker
Press Ctr C to exit.
Now, enter sudo docker –version to check if docker is installed.

POST INSTALLATION
If you don’t want to preface the docker command with sudo, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. When the Docker daemon starts, it creates a Unix socket accessible by members of the docker group.
1.	Create the docker group.
$ sudo groupadd docker
2.	Add your user to the docker group.
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
3.	Restart your Server by entering exit and log back in.
4.	Now type docker - -version to check if it works. You should be able to enter docker commands without using sudo.
